# Grid-Based Robot Navigation with Markovian Dynamics

This grid-based robot navigation study investigates autonomous robot navigation within grid environments using programming in R. Employing Markov chain principles, this simulation model provides dynamic insights into navigation patterns, introduces energy constraints and explores future directions for practical applications.
